## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. Tkinter is included with Python installations by default.
- **AWS Credentials**: Configure your AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or by setting up environment variables.

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Clone the Repository**: To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
    ![git_clone](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6672bebb-6052-4dfe-8bcf-2d8c0ad6b67e)

    ```bash 
    git clone https://github.com/MaheshShukla1/IAM-Manager-GUI.git
    ```
    
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:
    # ![cd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/764f0bb4-0f65-46ba-98bb-cf391fa2cd1c)

    ```bash  
    cd IAM-Manager-GUI
    ```
    
3. **Install Python Dependencies**: Install the required Python packages using pip:
    
    ```bash    
    pip install boto3
    ```
    
    The `boto3` library is used for interacting with AWS IAM. Tkinter is included with Python and does not require separate installation.
    
4. **Verify Installation**: Ensure that the dependencies are correctly installed and that Python is set up properly by running a test script or starting the application.

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Basic User Management

Create a user named "test-user":

1. Go to "Create User".
2. Enter "test-user" and click "Create".

### Example 2: Role Management with Policy Attachment

1. Create a role:
    
    - Go to "Create Role".
    - Enter "test-role" and provide trust policy JSON.
    
2. Attach a policy:
    
    - Go to "Attach Policy to Role".
    - Enter "test-role" and policy ARN.
    

## Troubleshooting

**Q: The application is not starting.**

A: Ensure the following:

- Python 3.x is installed. Verify by running `python --version` in the terminal.
- Dependencies are installed. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required packages.
- Check if `boto3` and `tkinter` are properly installed. You can test `boto3` by running a simple script that initializes an AWS client, and `tkinter` by running a basic GUI example.

**Q: AWS credentials are not working.**

A: Follow these steps:

- Verify AWS credentials are correctly configured using the AWS CLI. Run `aws configure` and check if the credentials are valid.
- Ensure that the IAM user has the necessary permissions for the operations being performed.
- Check if the AWS credentials are set in the environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).

**Q: Application is crashing with a `ClientError`.**

A: This might be due to:

- Invalid permissions or incorrect API usage. Review the AWS IAM policies and ensure the API requests are correct.
- Network issues. Ensure that there is a stable internet connection and that there are no firewall rules blocking the AWS API endpoints.

**Q: Logs are not updating or displaying correctly.**

A: Check the following:

- Ensure the logging configuration is correctly set up and that the `logging` module is properly initialized.
- Verify that the `Text` widget or log display area is properly updated from the main thread using `self.root.after()`.

**Q: Dialog boxes are not displaying or are unresponsive.**

A: Make sure:

- Dialogs are invoked on the main thread. Use `self.root.after()` to schedule UI updates from background threads.
- Ensure that `self.dialog_active` is correctly managed to prevent overlapping dialogs.

**Q: Errors in creating or deleting users.**

A: Verify:

- User input validity. Ensure usernames and passwords meet AWS IAM requirements.
- Check for any AWS-specific limitations or conditions, such as naming constraints and policy attachments.
